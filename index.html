    <p class="description"> How do you take care of your computer? You have to remember to charge your computer or it won't work, close tabs when it's being slow, and troubleshoot when something is wrong with it. Your brain is like a computer and just like a computer you need to let it rest and recharge, stop doing things when it's getting tired and slow, and finding out what's wrong when something is off.</p>
